## Introduction

This project utilizes Arduino and FastLED library to create a snake game that can be played on LED matrices. The game offers two distinct modes, allowing players to experience both classic snake gameplay and a unique mode based on apple colors.

## Features

- Classic snake gameplay with adjustable speed.
- Alternate game mode where the snake eats apples according to their colors.
- LED matrix-based display for an engaging gaming experience.
- Gesture and button-based controls for navigating the snake.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino Mega 2560 CH340
- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
- Pi Camera3
- WS2812B LEDS (749 leds)
- Gesture sensor (DFRobot_PAJ7620U2)
- Generic arcade buttons for controls
- Frosted acrylic screen
- Speakers with AUX cable
- Speaker Module

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Python
- FastLED library
- Adafruit NeoMatrix libary
- DFRobot_PAJ7620U2 library
- LinkedList library 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Arduino IDE.
3. Install the required libraries mentioned in the [Software Requirements](#software-requirements).
4. Connect your Arduino board and configure the board settings.
5. Upload the code to your Arduino.

## Usage

1. Wire up the hardware components as per the provided schematics.
2. Upload the code to your Arduino.
3. Power up the Arduino and start playing the game.

## Game Modes

### Classic Snake Game
- Control the snake using buttons or gestures.
- Eat apples and avoid collisions with the snake's body or boundaries.

### Apple Color Mode
- The snake needs to eat apples according to their colors.
- Each apple has a different color, and the snake must eat apples matching a specified color.

## Controls

- Button A: Move down
- Button B: Move left
- Button C: Move up
- Button D: Move right
- Gesture Sensor: Alternate control method based on gestures (if enabled)
- Computer Vision Based control: Alternate control method based on Computer Vision (if enabled)
